# Bank management System

this started ot to be a very basic project with th main aim to perform all the 
basic operations that a normal bank can perform

    1)  Opening a bank account
    2)  viewing the opened bank account using password
    3)  Withdrawing money
    4)  Depositing money
these all functions are incorporated in the very first version of it and I am trying to use file operations to keep track of all the opened accounts in a file so to have a permanent storage and also adding some more functions like
    
    1)  Forgot password
    2)  Delete account
    3)  Fixed deposit
    4)  Taking Loan

This is the complete overview of this mini project of me in c++
